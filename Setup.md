Getting Started
===============

This is a quick introduction on how to set up LEDscape on a Debian-based image

Setting up the BBB environment
==============================

To develop for LEDscape on a Debian environment, Start by copying the latest BBB image to an SD card. These instructions were made using version bone-debian-7.5-2014-05-14-2gb.img. The latest version can be found at:

    http://elinux.org/BeagleBoardDebian#Demo_Image

First, we need to expand the image to use the whole SD card. By default, it is only 2GB.

    cd /opt/scripts/tools/
    sudo ./grow_partition.sh
    sudo reboot

Next, update the the Debian environment:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install usbmount
    
Disable the HDMI output:

    sudo sed -i 's/#cape_disable=capemgr.disable_partno=BB-BONELT-HDMI,BB-BONELT-HDMIN/cape_disable=capemgr.disable_partno=BB-BONELT-HDMI,BB-BONELT-HDMIN'/g /boot/uboot/uEnv.txt
    sudo reboot

Note: These packages used to be required, but now are included in the default image. You might need to install them if you're using a different Debian system.

    sudo apt-get install git build-essential

Next, set up LEDscape:
======================

Use git to download the repository:

    cd /opt
    sudo git clone http://github.com/Blinkinlabs/LEDscape.git
    cd LEDscape
    sudo git checkout -b videoplayer origin/videoplayer
    sudo make
    
Copy the device tree file into place, and add it to the slots:

    sudo cp dts/CAPE-BONE-OCTO-00A0.dtbo /lib/firmware
    echo 'CAPE-BONE-OCTO' | sudo tee -a /sys/devices/bone_capemgr.9/slots
    
Then run the identification program to test if all is well:

    sudo bin/identify

Make a configuration file for your screen
=========================================

The configuration file is what tells LEDscape how to draw it's virtual screen onto your matrix tiles or LED strips. There are two basic formats:

Matrix screen
-------------

Let's look at a sample matrix configuration. Here's one for a small display consisting of 4 LED matricies, arranged in a square:

    matrix16
    0,6 N 0,0
    0,7 N 32,0
    1,6 N 0,16
    2,7 N 32,16
    
The first line of the configuration file describes the type of matrix. Here are the valid matrix types:

| Type      | Description           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| matrix16      | 32x16 LED matrix, 1/8th scanning (three address pins) |

Each following line consists of three sets of information: Controller position, Rotation, and LEDscape virtual screen offset.

The controller position consists of two values. The first is the output channel. This corresponds to the physical output that the matrix is plugged into on the board. There are 8 outputs available on the OCTOscroller shield. The second is the position in the output chain. This one is a little more tricky, as it is backwards from you might expect. The *first* matrix panel in the chain, which is the one connected to the OCTOscroller shield, is called 7. The second one is called 6, and so on, until the eighth and final one. For example, a single matrix panel connected to output #3 has the following controller position:

    3,7
    
The rotation is any one of the following values: N, U, L, R. 'N' and 'U' are used when the long side of the panel is parallel to the ground, and 'L' and 'R' are used when it is perpendicular. Try one, then the other, to figure out the correct orientation for your panels.

The Virtual screen offset is the top-left position in the LEDscape virtual screen that will be drawn to this matrix panel. Normally you will want to map sections of the screen into contigouos regions, so the top-left panel in your display should have a virtual screen offset of 0,0, then the panel to the right of that one should be offset by the width of the first panel, either 16,0 or 32,0, and so on.


WS2812 strips
-------------

Let's look at a sample WS2812 strip configuration. Here's one that can control a single strip output:

    ws2812
    64,48

The first line of the configuration file describes the type of matrix. Here are the valid matrix types:

| Type          | Description           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| ws2812        | Strip of WS2812/WS2812B LEDs, aka NeoPixels |

TODO: What do the next numbers here mean?

Testing your configuration
--------------------------

For matricies, there is a handy identification program to draw some text that identifies each panel. Run it to test your new configuration:

    sudo bin/identify myconfig.config


Set up the UDP listener to display incoming packets
===================================================
    
To run the matrix listener:
    
    bin/matrix-udp-rx sign.config n/matrix-udp-rx -W 256 -H 32 -c sign.config &
    
There are a bunch of command line arguments, and the whole thing seems to be in a bit of flux. Here's what exists now:

| Argument      | Description           | Default |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| -v      | Verbose mode |  |
| -n      | Skip LEDscape initialization      | |
| -c      | Configuration file to use. Note: Use full pathname, for example: /home/debian/LEDscape/default.config      | |
| -t      | Number of seconds the display server will show the previous image before timing out      | 60 |
| -W      | LEDscape virtual screen width      | 256 |
| -H      | LEDscape virtual screen height      | 128 |
| -m      | Message to display at startup      | |


Run the UDP listener automatically at system boot
=================================================

    sudo cp bin/ledscape.service /etc/systemd/system
    sudo systemctl enable ledscape.service

    sudo cp bin/videoplayer.service /etc/systemd/system
    sudo systemctl enable videoplayer.service

Video playback
==============

Playing a video is as simple as running the video player (after running the UDP listener):

    bin/video_player.py -s 256x32 -l ../Daft\ Punk\ -\ Around\ The\ World.avi
    
Note: These packages used to be required, but now are included in the default image. You might need to install them if you're using a different Debian system.

    sudo apt-get install libavformat-dev x264 v4l-utils ffmpeg
    sudo apt-get install libcv2.3 libcvaux2.3 libhighgui2.3 python-opencv opencv-doc libcv-dev libcvaux-dev libhighgui-dev

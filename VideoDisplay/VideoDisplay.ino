  Required Connections
  --------------------
    pin 2:  LED Strip #1    OctoWS2811 drives 8 LED Strips.
    pin 14: LED strip #2    All 8 are the same length.
    pin 7:  LED strip #3
    pin 8:  LED strip #4    A 100 to 220 ohm resistor should used
    pin 6:  LED strip #5    between each Teensy pin and the
    pin 20: LED strip #6    wire to the LED strip, to minimize
    pin 21: LED strip #7    high frequency ringining & noise.
    pin 5:  LED strip #8
    pin 15 & 16 - Connect together, but do not use
    pin 4:  Do not use
    pin 3:  Do not use as PWM.  Normal use is ok.
    pin 12: Frame Sync

    When using more than 1 Teensy to display a video image, connect
    the Frame Sync signal between every board.  All boards will
    synchronize their WS2811 update using this signal.

    Beware of image distortion from long LED strip lengths.  During
    the WS2811 update, the LEDs update in sequence, not all at the
    same instant!  The first pixel updates after 30 microseconds,
    the second pixel after 60 us, and so on.  A strip of 120 LEDs
    updates in 3.6 ms, which is 10.8% of a 30 Hz video frame time.
    Doubling the strip length to 240 LEDs increases the lag to 21.6%
    of a video frame.  For best results, use shorter length strips.
    Multiple boards linked by the frame sync signal provides superior
    video timing accuracy.

    A Multi-TT USB hub should be used if 2 or more Teensy boards
    are connected.  The Multi-TT feature allows proper USB bandwidth
    allocation.  Single-TT hubs, or direct connection to multiple
    ports on the same motherboard, may give poor performance.

// The actual arrangement of the LEDs connected to this Teensy 3.0 board.
// LED_HEIGHT *must* be a multiple of 8.  When 16, 24, 32 are used, each
// strip spans 2, 3, 4 rows.  LED_LAYOUT indicates the direction the strips
// are arranged.  If 0, each strip begins on the left for its first row,
// then goes right to left for its second row, then left to right,
// zig-zagging for each successive row.
//
// Since the receiving program on the host is slicing the image,
// only the width matters.  The height is always 8.

// are percentages, from 0 to 100.  For a large LED installation with many
// Teensy 3.0 boards driving groups of LEDs, these parameters allow you to
// program each Teensy to tell the video application which portion of the
// video it displays.  By reading these numbers, the video application can
// automatically configure itself, regardless of which serial port COM number
// or device names are assigned to each Teensy 3.0 by your operating system.

//   '$' = Frame of image data, with frame sync pulse to be sent
